All the Calculated and restricted key figures are stored in the table RSZELTDIR To view all the calculated key figures & restricted key figures, go to SE16 and give the 'Definition type of an element' as CKF(calculated KF) and SEL(Restricted KF).

This will give you the ID. You can then give this ID in the table RSZELTXREF to find the Element ID of the query & the infocube on which this KF is defined.( First ID in this table is the ID of the query and the 2nd ID is the ID of the query component).

You can then use this query element ID in the table RSRREPDIR to get the query technical name.
