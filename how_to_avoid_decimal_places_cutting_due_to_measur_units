Please take this unit to table T006 and check two fields ANDEC and DECAN.

If they are set to 0, then it should be the reason why decimal is cut off.

To change this setting, go to SPRO ->SAP NetWeaver -> General Settings -> Check Units of Measurement, for the unit, change "Decimal places" and "Decimal pl. rounding" to 3.
